## Introduction

Hello I am an iOS Developer from _India_ (Currently working in _China_). Though I started my carrier with `Objective-C`, I have now worked extensively on `Swift` while making use of open source solutions like:
- `Alamofire` (To simplify HTTP networking) 
- `RealmSwift` + `ObjectMapper` (To store and expose data as objects) 
- `SnapKit` (To make autolayout easy)
- `Eureka` (To quickly create forms)
- `Chatto` + `Starscream` (To build chat apps)
I understand the importance of code review and refactoring. `SwiftLint` and `R.swift` help! I am always thriving to learn the latest technology and have attended Apple's WWDC18 & 19.
